//TEF6686HN/V102 xdr-gtk控制程序
//作者 eggplant886
// rds add by stailus - base from https://github.com/stailus/tef6686_rds
// niq_ro added some switches using stailus hints
// niq_ro added encoder for volume
// niq_ro added LCD2004 (i2c) 
// niq_ro added RT and PI from RDS data using (again) hints from stailus
// niq_addded PTY
// niq_ro added RT from makserge - https://github.com/makserge/tef6686_radio
